' Macro1 NextMarkAndCopy
' Very simple but useful macro that moves down to the next cell, hilights, and copies the value
' there. This is useful when working down a list of items, by marking that row as "done" and
' making its contents available for pasting to another location or document. This also prevents you
' from skipping or repeating a row because the hilight marks your progress.  Attach the macro
' to yoor Quick Access Toolbar or bind it to a key to make it easy to use.
